## Hello!

I’m Devapriya C C — a student, problem-solver, and AI enthusiast.  
Currently pursuing my B.Tech in AI & DS, I’m passionate about using data and code to understand the world and improve it.

I love experimenting with:
- Machine Learning pipelines  
- Real-world classification problems  
- Natural Language Processing tasks  
- Ethical and explainable AI

When I’m not coding, I’m probably learning something new, sketching out a project idea, or discussing the future of AI.

Let’s build what’s next.
